### Slalom

This game simulates a slalom run down a course with one to 25 gates. The user picks the number of gates and has some control over his speed down the course.

If you’re not a skier, here’s your golden opportunity to try it with minimal risk. If you are a skier, here’s something to do while your leg is in a cast.

SLALOM was written by J. Panek while a student at Dartmouth College.
