### Salvo

The rules are _not_ explained by the program, so read carefully this description by Larry Siegel, the program author.

SALVO is played on a 10x10 grid or board using an x,y coordinate system. The player has 4 ships:
- battleship (5 squares)
- cruiser (3 squares)
- two destroyers (2 squares each)

The ships may be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and must not overlap. The ships do not move during the game.

As long as any square of a battleship still survives, the player is allowed three shots, for a cruiser 2 shots, and for each destroyer 1 shot. Thus, at the beginning of the game the player has 3+2+1+1=7 shots. The players enters all of his shots and the computer tells what was hit. A shot is entered by its grid coordinates, x,y. The winner is the one who sinks all of the opponents ships.

Important note: Your ships are located and the computerâ€™s ships are located on 2 _separate_ 10x10 boards.

Author of the program is Lawrence Siegel of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
