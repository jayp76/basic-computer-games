# How to run the games

The games in this repository have been translated into a number of different languages. How to run them depends on the target language.

## python

The python translations can be run from the command line by using the `py` interpreter. If not already installed, a copy can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for **Windows**, **MacOS** and **Linux**.

1. From the command-line, navigate to the corresponding directory.
1. Invoke with the `py` or `python` interpreter (depending on your python version).
   * eg. `py acey_ducey_oo.py`
   * eg. `python aceyducey.py`

**Note**

Some translations include multiple versions for python, such as `acey ducey` which features versions for Python 2 (`aceyducey.py`) and Python 3 (`acey_ducey.py`) as well as an extra object-oriented version (`acey_ducey_oo.py`).

You can manage and use different versions of python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
